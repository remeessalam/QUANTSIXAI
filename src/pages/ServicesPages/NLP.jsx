          Natural Language Processing (NLP) is at the intersection of
          linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, enabling
          machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. From
          automating text analysis to enabling conversational AI, NLP bridges
          the gap between humans and machines.
